    <h1>The water secret Big Agua doesn't want you to know</h1>
    <p>So-called health experts say water is vital to our well-being, but don&rsquo;t be fooled. Those agenda-hiding charlatans would like nothing better than for us to drink up their lies.</p>

<p>Water is a slippery, see-through, watery poison, and it&rsquo;s killing us from the inside out.</p>

<p>The pro-water lobby spouts $10 words, like &ldquo;hydration,&rdquo; &ldquo;dehydration&rdquo; and &ldquo;water.&rdquo; Look, I don&rsquo;t have a fancy science degree from an elitist university, but I know subterfuge when I see it.</p>

<p>Allow me to learn you a truth or two about this &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; elixir called water. My cousin&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s school recently banned all beverages except water. Now two kids in Grade 1 are allergic to rhubarb. Coincidence?</p>

<p>Up to 80 per cent of children baptized (with water) in their first month of life fail to speak in full sentences until three years later, according to the Family Unhydration Freedom Coalition.</p>

<p>Another common side effect of water is death. Every year, about 55 million people die around the world. Most are from countries &mdash; the same countries where water consumption is not only permitted, it is encouraged by public health authorities.</p>

<p>Advertisement Article content continued Do you even realize what water is made from? One ingredient is hydrogen &mdash; perfectly harmless, right? Ah, no.</p>

<p>Ever heard of the hydrogen bomb? Yeah, it&rsquo;s a thermonuclear weapon that uses hydrogen &ldquo;fusion&rdquo; to create giant, deadly, mushroom-cloud-making &ldquo;explosions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other ingredient in water is oxygen. According to the internet, Michael Jackson, a famous llama owner, used to sleep in an oxygen chamber. That would be the Michael Jackson who is no longer alive. (He is dead.)</p>

<p>Will drinking a cocktail of hydrogen and oxygen cause you to explode or die (or both)? Is there zero-per-cent risk? Who can say for sure?</p>

<p>Then there are the chemicals added to drinking water, like fluoride. Again, I&rsquo;m no scientist, but I know that nothing good comes from consuming anything ending in &ldquo;ide&rdquo; &mdash; be it peroxide, cyanide or poisontoxicide.</p>

<p>I realize that doctors, scientists, public health experts, nutritionists and medical researchers think water is good for us. But Reginald McWellend, a commenter on the Facebook page for HardWaterTruths.com, has this to say: &ldquo;Water isn&rsquo;t 100% safe NO WAY!!! Get informed. Make YOUR OWN decisions!&rdquo; (257 likes).</p>

<p>The &ldquo;experts&rdquo; would love for us to ignore people like Reginald, who have no education or training in any area related to health or science or &ldquo;facts.&rdquo; But the actual reason health &ldquo;experts&rdquo; ignore waterblowers (water whistleblowers) is that they are all in the pocket of Big Agua.</p>

<p>Advertisement Article content continued Water is not just a liquid; it&rsquo;s an industry. Unscrupulous water manufacturers have paid off every health expert on earth, according to the article &ldquo;Water risks THEY don&rsquo;t want YOU to know!&rdquo; in the online newsletter Natural Wellness Goodness.</p>

<p>This is a worldwide conspiracy, funded by dirty water money, perpetrated by mainstream medicine. Health &ldquo;experts&rdquo; are not only hiding the truth, they are intent on harming us all (babies in particular).</p>

<p>Health &ldquo;experts&rdquo; blab about &ldquo;peer-reviewed studies&rdquo; and &ldquo;empirical evidence.&rdquo; Unfortunately for them, we all have access to a little thing called the internet. Type a few words into Google &mdash; start with &ldquo;water,&rdquo; &ldquo;deadly&rdquo; and &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo; &mdash; and you will discover the truth.</p>

<p>Educate before you hydrate. Think before you drink. You are the expert on what&rsquo;s healthiest for you.</p>

<p>You should never put a substance in your body &ndash; be it water or some vaccine &ndash; until you have visited every obscure website that lists all the things that are horrible about it. Only then can you make an educated decision to not drink water.</p>
