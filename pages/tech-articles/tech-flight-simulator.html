    <h1>Make a better flight simulator for safer skies</h1>
    <p>The motion of most flight simulators is more  like that of a rocking chair than an airplane.  That's fine for simulating a flight where the  most severe event is a shortage of Diet Coke.  Not so good for training pilots to regain control in actual emergencies.</p>

    <p>&quot;It's one thing to push some buttons in  a cockpit. It's quite another to do it while  you are spinning,&quot; says Metin Yaras, chair of  Carleton's department of mechanical and  aerospace engineering.</p>

    <p>The goal of its Simulator Project is to create  a more realistic flight experience. The simulator's spherical cockpit was designed so that  there are no restrictions to movement. It will  go up, down, forward, backward, and side to side and will spin in any direction. Its visual  system projects images onto spherical surfaces, as opposed to the flat displays of most simulators, further enhancing realism.</p>

    <p>More than 200 engineering students have  contributed to the project, facing many  challenges in the decade since its inception. Finding space for the 4.3-metre-tall structure meant digging a pit in a lab. Students had to write their own software, manufacture their own parts, and design a system of sensors and cameras to track the cockpit's orientation.</p>

    <p>&quot;Another major challenge is that, because the cockpit can spin, we can't have any  mechanical attachments to it for power, data  exchange, or ventilation,&quot; says engineering professor Robert Langlois, the project  manager.</p>

    <p>Construction of the simulator began last September and should be completed within two years. &quot;If it does everything we think it can do, it will have all kinds of applications,&quot; says Langlois, who envisions it being used in  education, for research, and to train commercial, military, and aerobatic pilots.</p>

    <p>Better simulators make for safer skies. So does the experience gained by the hundreds of student engineers who worked on this project, says Langlois. &quot;The contribution to the simulation industry goes far beyond this simulator.&quot;</p>
